| Description:                                                                                                        |
| Structural design patterns focus on simplifying the relationships between objects or classes. They aim to ensure    |
| that these entities work together seamlessly, often by defining clear and flexible compositions.                    |
| These patterns help in organizing code, improving readability, and enabling scalable system architectures.          |
|                                                                                                                     |
| Key Benefits:                                                                                                       |
| - Promote flexibility by defining clear relationships between objects and classes.                                  |
| - Enable reusability by simplifying compositions and encouraging modular designs.                                   |
| - Improve system maintainability and scalability by decoupling components.                                          |
|                                                                                                                     |
