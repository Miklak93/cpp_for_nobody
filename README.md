# C++ for nobody

## About  

(Non-)educational C++ repository that contains some code and some text, but I'd be genuinely surprised if anyone besides me finds it useful.
But I know that some people likes random walks over Github. So for you, dear traveler, the LATEX code for *"Notes on a cuff"* is placed
in `documentation/notes`.

As for the rest of the code, I’ve just started implementing algorithms and data structures, so it’s far from being even remotely acceptable.
As for design patterns, there’s plenty of room for improvement, but at least they work.
